               Before masters, I was working as a software engineer for two
               years, in India. I worked extensively on Python and automation
               during these period.

               During my Uni, I got interested in web, data and security. And
               luckily, I got to work on all these areas during my time as a
               Research Assistant to the UNSW School of Marketing and Economics.
               Had great fun with Python, Computer Vision and AI.
